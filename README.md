# Hi

the blog bog

## what?

retroweb site yay! indie web. made (somewhat) in parallel with skz and for SOM (summer of making)

## why?

self expression I suppose? Also, cute graphics. The indie web is really cool :)

I discovered the whole concept of personal websites during the summer of 2020, and that introduced me to webdev as a whole! It's nice to take a break from like, modern frameworks and make some very DIY style things
